Ideas for readPost()
########################################

->Jason's
----------------------------------------
Use a database with a schema like:
	readID: ObjectID
	userID:	The user who read the post id
	postID: To identify which post the user has read

Then we will need the following functions implemented.
	1. void readPost() - To persist the reading event.
	2. boolean hasRead() - Does a simple query to the database via Mongoose and if it finds a result
							it returns true (the user read the post) else returns false.

For more information on how to use Mongoose:

	* NB: Please do the database connections, persistence and query in an external file
		  Keep the functions readPost() and hasRead() in the Threads.js file.
